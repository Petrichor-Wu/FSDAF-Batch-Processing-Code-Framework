# FSDAF-Batch-Processing-Code-Framework
This project offers a stable and efficient batch processing framework for the FSDAF (Flexible Spatio-temporal Data Fusion) algorithm. It includes Python scripts and configuration files for time-series remote sensing data matching, fusion, and preprocessing, optimized using NDVI data as an example.
